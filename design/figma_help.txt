Link to Figma with all the designed features listed that didn't get implemented can be found
from wiki from page "Further Development". From this design folder you can find pdf pictures 
of the Figma pages and local copy of the Figma. Here is how you can open the copy in Figma:

1. Go to Figma home page and press "import" from top right.
2. Drag the "zeebe workflow monitor -Figma" file there.
3. Open. If you want to use the prototype, click the play button from to right.
